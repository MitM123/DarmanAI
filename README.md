# Emoji Tic-Tac-Toe üéÆ

A modern twist on classic Tic-Tac-Toe using emojis with special gameplay rules!

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Audio**: Howler.js for sound effects

## Game Features
### Emoji Categories
Players can choose from three fun emoji categories:
- üê∂ **Animals** (Default for Player 1)
- üçï **Food** (Default for Player 2)
- ‚öΩ **Sports**

### Special Rules Implementation
1. **3-Emoji Limit**: Each player can only have 3 emojis on the board at any time
2. **FIFO Removal**: When placing a 4th emoji, the oldest emoji is automatically removed
3. **Placement Restriction**: The 4th emoji cannot be placed where the 1st emoji was

*Note: I tried my best to implement the visual "vanishing" effect when changing emojis or categories. But mixing it with the FIFO system made it tricky ‚Äî so I‚Äôve done as much as possible for now.*

## How to Play
1. Select battle mode (vs Bot or vs Friend)
2. Choose your emoji categories
3. Take turns placing emojis
4. First to get 3 in a row wins!

## Future Improvements
With more time, I would:
- Create responsive animations for emoji placement
- Enhance Battle Mode to support both Bot and Friend battles in the same gameplay environment
- smoother transitions and game management

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
